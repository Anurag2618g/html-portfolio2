<h1>About Me</h1>
Greetings, everyone! I'm Anurag Gupta, hailing from the culturally rich city of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, renowned for its iconic "Bareilly ka jhumka" and the revered Alakhnath Temple. Originating from a tight-knit nuclear family of five, I am the son of Mr. Arun Gupta, a distinguished businessman, and Mrs. Lavy Gupta, an exceptional homemaker, alongside two accomplished elder sisters.

Currently immersed in my pursuit of excellence in BTech CSE, I bring with me a robust academic foundation from the esteemed CBSE board. Beyond academia, my passions encompass sports, where I find solace, and the world of anime, a realm I ardently embrace.

My professional aspiration converges toward becoming a proficient web developer, driven by my innate ability to swiftly comprehend complex concepts and unwavering focus. However, transparency requires me to acknowledge that monotony tends to disengage my interest in tasks.

In the grand tapestry of motivation, my North Star is unequivocally my parents, whose unwavering support serves as a perennial source of inspiration. I eagerly anticipate the collective growth and camaraderie we shall forge.
